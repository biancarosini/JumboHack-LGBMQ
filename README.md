GOaling Down The Rabbit Hole
================================================================================
Created by: LGBMQ (Lily Mosisa, Bianca Rosini, Marina Escandell Tapias, Quinn Hinde-Schuster)
Presented at JumboHack 2025 under the Down The Rabbit Hole track.

"GOaling Down the Rabbit Hole" is an Alice in Wonderland themed goal tracker that blends childlike wonder with adult reality. As you work towards your goal, the white rabbit falls further down the rabbit hole, towards the tea party--but, if you don't finish your goal on time, you are met with the wrath of the queen of hearts, and a text message is sent to a number of your choosing. Whether you set it to text your ex, your friends, or yourself, we hope it's enough motivation to get things done. Don't be late!

*Since we are beginners, the text message feature does not actually send a text--we just wanted to include this feature from a product design perspective. Instead, it shows a message showing who the message was hypothetically sent to and what the message contains.

Our goal for this project was to gain more practice coding web-based applications, specifically by learning React. We accomplished this goal, and also learned how to use Github to code collaboratively in the process!

Optional Reflection:

What motivated your team to choose this project?
The name of the beginner track, "Down The Rabbit Hole," helped inspire the theme of this project. From there, we wanted to make something that was somewhat near our skill level, so we landed on a goal tracker (with a risk element to motivate)!

Potential future work/improvements?
In the future, we would like to make it so that the program actually sends a text message to the number you choose if you fail to complete your goal in time.

Tell us about a tricky bug and/or design challenge that you encountered. How did your team tackle it together?
It was most of our team's first time using git, so the setup was particularly tricky. We had to figure out how to define which way we should handle merges, which ended up causing a lot of problems on one of our teammate's computers and set us back time-wise.
