# JumboHack-LGBMQ
The Project: Our team LGBMQ wanted to create an Alice in Wonderland theme goal tracker that blended childlike wonder (the bunny completing the goal and falling into a tea party or the bunny not completeing the goal and meeting the Queen of Hearts) with adult reality (sending a text message at failure as motivation to get things done).
